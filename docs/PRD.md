5.3 Data Flow Examples
5.3.1 Employee Updates ROI Data
1. Employee edits "Hours saved" field in UI
   ↓
2. onChange event triggers → auto-save after 1s debounce
   ↓
3. Frontend calls API: PATCH /api/projects/:id
   ↓
4. API route validates session (Supabase Auth)
   ↓
5. API updates database (Supabase PostgreSQL)
   ↓
6. Database returns updated record
   ↓
7. Frontend re-calculates metrics (ROI = hours * wage)
   ↓
8. UI updates with new values + "Saved ✓" indicator
5.3.2 Client Views Dashboard
1. Client logs in with email/password
   ↓
2. Supabase Auth validates credentials → returns session token
   ↓
3. Next.js checks user type (client vs. employee)
   ↓
4. Redirects to /dashboard/client
   ↓
5. Page fetches data: GET /api/dashboard?clientId=123
   ↓
6. API queries database with RLS (only returns data for clientId=123)
   ↓
7. Frontend renders dashboard with fetched data
   ↓
8. Charts calculate and display ROI visualizations
5.4 Security Architecture
5.4.1 Row-Level Security (RLS) in Supabase
Policy: Clients can only see their own data
sqlCREATE POLICY "Clients can view own data"
ON projects
FOR SELECT
USING (auth.uid() IN (
  SELECT user_id FROM user_clients WHERE client_id = projects.client_id
));
Policy: Employees can see all data
sqlCREATE POLICY "Employees can view all data"
ON projects
FOR SELECT
USING (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM users WHERE id = auth.uid() AND role = 'employee'
  )
);
5.4.2 Authentication Flow

Email verification required on signup
JWT tokens stored in HTTP-only cookies (XSS protection)
Session expiration after 7 days (configurable)
Password reset via email link

5.4.3 API Security

All API routes validate Supabase session token
CORS configured for production domain only
Rate limiting on auth endpoints (prevent brute force)

5.4.4 Server-Side Database Access Architecture 🚨 CRITICAL

Problem Statement:
When using Supabase's ANON_KEY for database queries in Server Components and layouts, Row-Level Security (RLS) policies are enforced. This can cause:
- Permission denied errors when querying user roles
- Infinite redirect loops in layouts when role verification fails
- Inconsistent behavior due to RLS timing issues

Solution: SERVICE_ROLE_KEY for Server-Side Queries

Technical Implementation:

1. **THREE SUPABASE CLIENT TYPES:**

   a) **Browser Client (`lib/supabase-browser.ts`)** - ANON_KEY
      - For: Client Components only
      - Enforces: RLS on all queries
      - Use case: Form submissions, client-side mutations

   b) **Server Client (`lib/supabase-server.ts`)** - ANON_KEY + Cookies
      - For: Authentication checks only
      - Enforces: RLS on all queries
      - Use case: `auth.getUser()`, `auth.getSession()`

   c) **Admin Client (`lib/supabase-admin.ts`)** - SERVICE_ROLE_KEY ⭐
      - For: ALL data queries in Server Components, layouts, API routes
      - Bypasses: ALL RLS policies
      - Use case: Fetching projects, users, clients, etc.

2. **USAGE PATTERN IN SERVER COMPONENTS:**

```typescript
// CORRECT: Separate auth from data queries
import { createClient } from '@/lib/supabase-server'
import { createAdminClient } from '@/lib/supabase-admin'

export default async function Page() {
  // 1. Auth check with regular client
  const supabase = await createClient()
  const { data: { user } } = await supabase.auth.getUser()
  if (!user) redirect('/login')

  // 2. ALL data queries with admin client
  const supabaseAdmin = createAdminClient()
  const { data } = await supabaseAdmin.from('projects').select('*')

  return <div>{/* render */}</div>
}
```

3. **CRITICAL: Layout Pattern** (prevents infinite redirects)

```typescript
// app/dashboard/client/layout.tsx
export default async function Layout({ children }) {
  const supabase = await createClient()
  const supabaseAdmin = createAdminClient()

  const { data: { user } } = await supabase.auth.getUser()
  if (!user) redirect('/login')

  // Must use admin client here to avoid RLS blocking role check
  const { data: userData } = await supabaseAdmin
    .from('users')
    .select('role')
    .eq('id', user.id)
    .single()

  if (userData?.role !== 'client') {
    redirect('/dashboard/employee')  // Won't create infinite loop
  }

  return <>{children}</>
}
```

4. **WHY THIS WORKS:**

   - SERVICE_ROLE_KEY has postgres role privileges (bypasses RLS)
   - Server Components run on server only (key never exposed to browser)
   - Middleware still enforces route protection
   - RLS policies still protect direct API access
   - No more permission errors or redirect loops

5. **SECURITY GUARANTEES:**

   - SERVICE_ROLE_KEY never sent to browser
   - Only available in server-side code
   - Middleware validates user roles before components render
   - RLS still protects against malicious direct database access
   - Client-side code still enforces RLS via ANON_KEY

Architecture Decision Record (ADR):

Decision: Use SERVICE_ROLE_KEY for all server-side data queries
Rationale: Eliminates RLS-related errors while maintaining security through Next.js middleware
Trade-off: Relies on application-level security (middleware) instead of database-level (RLS) for server components
Risk Mitigation: Middleware validates all requests; RLS still protects direct database access
